# FinalProject
## Topic
Due to the Pandemic changing how people view their health would the number of people with Diabetes change.

## Reason for Selected Topic 
Aging population in Canada, stress on healthcare increasing, need for faster care increasing.  Ontario’s Health system is and has been under immense strain since the start of the pandemic as demand for care exploded, with wait times increasing exponentially. Our Project model provides a solution to the diagnosis of diabetes incindences within a reasonable time frame.

Due to the Pandemic, we saw many people change how they take care of their health, as restaurants and fast food places were not allowed to have people in the restaurants since many governments enacted social distance policies. But even with the social distancing protocols, people could still "eat out" as most places used delivery apps or had a delivery service. So we hope to see if the number of people with diabetes will change because of how the Pandemic has changed how we view our health.

## Questions we hope to answer:
Has the total number of people with diabetes gone up or down due to the pandemic.

Machine Learning Model: Take in data from database 
and output labels for input data 
Supervised model - classification -similar to module 18 for credit risk

Features:Pregnancies: predictors.get_dummies()

Target: [‘Diabetes’]

## Description of Communitcation Protocol
To ensure we are able to communicate with each other when we have ideas, any problems , or for any other reason we created a slack group chat. We will also meet at least once a week outside of class and more if needed. There is also a shared google folder where we can upload any resources that could be useful, and it has a document where we track all of our ideas and it allows us to go back and review each others ideas.
