# Machine Learning Model KNN

### Description of preliminary data preprocessing
First, we removed any records with a null value in them. We then identified that for the following variables smokerid and drinkerid 
had a "no info" record; we decided to remove any record that had "no info" as we regarded this as a null value. We also encoded some of the columns' smokerid,
drinkerid, and famhistid as they offered responses and so we used each response as a new column with a response of 0 = No, and 1 =Yes. 

### Description of preliminary feature engineering and preliminary feature selection, including their decision-making process
The preliminary features that we decide to focus on if there was a family history of diabetes, the patient's current health such as their weight, 
BMI, and cholesterol; we also wanted to focus on activities that have a long-lasting effect on someone's health namely smoking and drinking. 

### Description of how data was split into training and testing sets
We split the data 20% for training and 80% for testing, the reason being that we had 57000+ records giving us enough to train the model and to test it with.

### Explanation of model choice, including limitations and benefits
To help predict whether someone has diabetes or not we decided to use a supervised model, namely a KNN model. The reason being we are trying to find a discrete 
outcome.

* Benefits
	* The KNN model is simple and easy to understand
	* The model has no assumptions
	* KNN models can adapt as more data is inputted
* Limitations
	* As the dataset grows the model gets slower when running
	* It is very sensitive when dealing with outliers
	* It has issues with dealing with imbalanced data
